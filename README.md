# CompareDatabases

This tool compares two different DVD Profiler databases with each other. It will show all profiles that have the same UPC/EAN and Locality and the difference between them.
You can use it if you want to merge two databases or if you have the same database on multiple computers.

To use the full functionality of this tool, youâ€™ll also need to install WinMerge, another free tool.
